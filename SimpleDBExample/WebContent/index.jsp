		<br> <br> In this project, your team will design and build a
		web application. A web application is a software application that is
		accessed over the Internet using standard browsers (e.g. Internet
		Explorer, Mozilla Firefox). Examples of web application would be
		online-shopping, web banking, stock exchange and many others. Each
		member of the team is expected to contribute equally to the project
		though there may be a variety of different roles.<br> <br>
		For the progress report deadline (<b>October 30</b>), you simply have
		to have your prototype web apps generate a "Hello World!" output (you
		don't need to have developed any of your backend functionality). <br>
		<br> Instructions on how to submit your prototypes will be posted
		closer to the due date.
